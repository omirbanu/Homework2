# Homework 2 - Group 23 
# In this assignment we perform an analysis of Taxis in NYC. In particular, we are curious to answer to some specific research questions (RQs) that may help Taxi drivers in planning their movements throughout the city and the Taxi's users to have hints about the convenience of enjoying this service.

# For this purpose we use the open data of Taxi's trips in NYC. In order to answer to the RQs we take into account the data related to Yellow cab for the year 2018.

# In this repository, you can find our notebook with the codes and the plots and also the html files, containing the maps we created,for each month, for all the pickup and dropoff locations respectively.
